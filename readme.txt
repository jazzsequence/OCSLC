OCSLC WordPress Theme Project

Please refer to this readme for any updates to the files.

The goal of this project is to create a child theme of Darren Hoyt's Mimbo theme (http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2007/08/05/wordpress-magazine-theme-released/) that uses custom menus and an alternate method for post thumbnails, among other cosmetic changes.

The most recent version of Mimbo can be found in this repository in the /mimbo directory.  Please note that this is *not* the way it would be in an actual WordPress environment...Mimbo would be in its' own directory -- this is just for convenience so people can have the same versions of the files for development purposes.
